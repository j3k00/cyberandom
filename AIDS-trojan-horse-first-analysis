Summary

On Monday, 11th December, several thousand diskettes were mailed out
containing a program that purported to give you information about
AIDS.  These diskettes actually contained a trojan - do not install
the program.  If you have installed it, you must remove it - see
Appendix 3 below for how.

The diskette

The diskette was sent out to 7,000 subscribers to the magazine PC
Business World, and also to a list obtained from the WHO conference on
AIDS in Stockholm in October 1988.  There may be other recipients, but
this has not been confirmed.

The diskette arrives in a square white envelope, containing a diskette
and a blue piece of paper.  The label on the diskette says "AIDS
Information Introductory Diskette Version 2.0", and give the following
instructions:

1. Start your computer
2. Insert this diskette in drive A
3. At the C> prompt, type A:INSTALL
4. Press ENTER

If you do this, it installs itself on your computer - this process is
described in more detail below in appendix 2.  The files on the
diskette are:

INSTALL.EXE      Sept 28 1989  146188 bytes
AIDS.EXE          Aug  7 1989  172562 bytes

The accompanying blue piece of paper is documented in appendix 3

When it is installed

When the installation is complete, a number of new files are on your
hard disk.  Extensive use is made of character 255 (hexadecimal FF)
which is invisible.  For the purposes of this report, we shall
represent it as #.  The "Space" character shall be represented as .

A file called AIDS.EXE is put on the root directory.  Two hidden
subdirectories are created in the root, called # and ###### (using
the notation defined above).  The # subdirectory contains a readonly,
hidden file called REM#.EXE.

The ###### subdirectory contains a hidden subdirectory called
######, which contains a hidden subdirectory called ######, which
contains a subdirectory called ERRORIN.THE, which contains nothing.
The ###### subdirectory also contains five files ____.__, _._,
___._, _._ and _.__ (where _ is the underline character, Acsii
95, and  is the space character, Acsii 32).  These files are all
readonly and hidden.

____.__ contains 17 bytes, and looks like it is the serial number
that the trojan gives you (see description of installation), but
encrypted.  _._ is six bytes and is a counter, counting the number
of times that REM# has been run.  After the first run of REM#, it is
eight bytes.  ___._ is one byte, an end-of-file marker (Ascii 26).
_.__ is 50401 bytes long, and consists of 252-byte records,
containing 250 spaces and a carriage-return, line-feed.

The installation also creates a new AUTOEXEC.BAT file, consisting of:

echo off
C:
cd\#
rem# PLEASE USE THE auto.bat FILE INSTEAD OF autoexec.bat FOR CONVENIENCE #
auto.bat

AUTO.BAT contains:

echo off
rem #PLEASE USE THIS FILE JUST LIKE AN autoexec.bat FILE FOR CONVENIENCE#

This is followed by "echo on", and then the lines from your original
AUTOEXEC.BAT - if you didn't have an AUTOEXEC, it has:

date
time


It also leaves a file called AUTOEXEC.BAK behind - this contains
"File not found". Perhaps if there was a file on the disk with a
certain name, this might contain the contents of that file.
If you had a file called AUTO.BAT, it is over-written.

The  "important reference number" varies from installation
to installation; every time the same diskette is installed, you get
a different number.

The trojan

Every time the computer is rebooted, AUTOEXEC runs the REM# program,
and the counter counts.  In all the tests that we have done, it counts
for precisely 90 boots.  After 90 boots, it goes into the damage
routine, which puts a series of messages up on the screen aimed at
preventing you from switching off, and spends a very long time
accessing the disk.  What it is actually doing, is first encrypting
the file names on the disk (see Appendix 4 for the encryption system)
and then it creates a very large file on the disk, filling it up.

The software

The AIDS program itself starts off by asking you a series of
questions about your lifestyle, including your country. The United
States is not an option here - this is consistent with the license
agreement's statement that the programs are not to be used there.
This program does not appear to do anything untoward to the computer,
but it is impossible to be certain about this. In appendix 6, we list
the text that is to be found inside the program.

When the questionnaire has been completed, the program gives you a
risk assessment on a scale of no risk to very high risk, and makes
some suggestions about how you can reduce your risk. It then offers
a screen into which you can type free-form questions, and gives
you answers. This phase appears to be looking for keywords, and
on recognising the keywords, it presents responses - this is a very
simple thing to program.

The INSTALL proram becomes the REM# program once installed - it is als
also the SHARE program. We have done a Dos COMP to verify this.

Analysis of the software

The software is a mixture of very simple, and rather complex.  The
AIDS program itself has features that look quite badly written - for
example, the messages are repetitive, and the free-form question and
answer routine looks like it picks out keywords and gives responses
based on those.  The REM# routine has an encryption system that uses
an IF - THEN - ELSE on a character by character basis, rather than a
string lookup, or an algorithm.  The program is written in Basic.

On the other hand, the program creates hidden subdirectories, and in
order to do this in Basic, a routine written in another language must
be linked in.  Also, the program intercepts Ctrl-Alt-Del, and this can
only be done by intercepting interrupt 9;  assembler is required.

So, the software is a mixture of the very simplistic, and the rather
sophisticated. Perhaps this is the work of two programmers, or
maybe one programmer who used routines from another source.

Analysis of the license

The license looks like every other software license, unless you read
it very carefully.  If you read it carefully, you can see the hooks.
First, it tells you about the "program mechanisms" to stop you using
the software.

In the case of your breach of this license agreement, PC Cyborg
Corporation reserves the right to take any legal action necessary to
recover any outstanding debts payable to PC Cyborg Corporation and to
use program mechanisms to ensure termination of your use of the
programs.

Then, it warns you that this will affect other programs.

These program mechanisms will adversely affect other program
applications on microcomputers.

Then it tells you that your computer will stop working properly.

You are hereby advised of the most serious consequences of your
failure to abide by the terms of this license agreement;  your
conscience may haunt you for the rest of your life;  you will owe
compensation and possible damages to PC Cyborg Corporation;  and your
microcomputer will stop functioning normally.  Warning:  Do not use
these programs unless you are prepared to pay for them.

Earlier on in the agreement, it explains that there is a mandatory
licensing fee - the programs are not free.  So the subsequent demands
for money - are they blackmail, or are they debt-collection?  It may
require a court case to decide.

Analysis of the purpose

What is the point of this diskette?  Is it the obvious one - PC Cyborg
is trying to sell software by direct mailshot, and is trying to
enforce payment by people who voluntarily decide to run it, and
therefore voluntarily decide to buy it?  Or is it an attempt at
blackmail - PC Cyborg realised that no-one would actually read the
license, but that many would run the program.  Or is it sabotage -
some organisation wishes to inflict damage on a large number of
computers?  Or is it purely random - someone without rational motives?

Certainly, a large sum of mony has been spent on this mail-out. At
least 10,000 diskettes have been posted (cost - perhaps 10,000),
and a PO Box and company have been set up, and a large amount of
software development undertaken. A figure of 20,000 is probably
an under-estimate. Who would want to spend this sort of money?

It is difficult to take this diskette at face value. Surely, no-one
would really expect that sufficiently many people would voluntarily
send $189 or $378 to a PO Box in Panama. And even when the trojan
is revealed, it is hard to believe that many people would send off
their money, especially as the encryption of file names would appear
to be easily reversible. In the light of the careful preparation of
this diskette, and the large sum of money spent, it is surely not
possible that the crude attempt at blackmail (if that is what it is)
is the only outcome.

Is it possible that we haven't heard the last from PC Cyborg?  Is it
possible that in several weeks time, we will get another letter which
is the real ransom note?  Or is this perhaps an attempt to blackmail
the next magazine that they might approach - certainly a mail-out of
this kind to a magazine's readers, does that magazine no good at all.
so, a threat to do the same trick to another magazine might be the
objective.

On the other hand, is it possible that we are dealing with simple
crackpots?  If so, there may be no motive, and what we have seen is
all there is.

The only hard fact we have, is that we do not know the motive behind
this mailshot, and our recommendation on how to remove the trojan is
based on this fact.

How it all happened

In April 1989, PC Cyborg Corporation was set up in Panama City with
$10,000 equity.  The three directors were Kitain Mekonen, Asrat
Wakjira and Fantu Mekesse.  The local agent was Lucio Bernal.  In
October 1989, Mr E Ketema took out a month's subscription to the
Business Centre in New Bond Street, London;  he claimed to be an
accountant.

A Mr E Ketema (not necessarily the same person) asked PC Business
World if he could do a mailshot to 7000 of their readers.  PC Business
World, in common with most magazines, rent their mailing list to
anyone who meets certain conditions.  Mr Ketema operated out of a
rented address at a Business Centre - there is no forwarding address.

Mr Ketema told the magazine that he would be sending out leaflets
advertising software written in Nigeria.  In fact, the AIDS diskette
was sent out to this list.  The sender also used a list of 3000 that
came from an AIDS conference in Stockholm in October 1988, and may
have used other lists (this is unconfirmed).

On Tuesday, the diskettes began to arrive.  Many people were made
suspicious by the license, and refrained from running the software,
but many others installed it.  We put out a warning on the Tuesday,
via CONNECT, the IBM PC User Group's conferencing system, and we also
informed the police.  The press picked up the story from Connect, and
on Wednesday morning, there was a front-page article warning people
not to install the software.  The other press picked it up from that,
and soon the fact of the trojan was reasonably well known.

Throughout Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, the diskettes continued to
arrive - most of them were intercepted by alert PC support staff, but
some were delivered directly to users, and were run.  On Thursday, we
received our first confirmed report of the program's trojan
activating.  Since then, we have received reports of others.  Some
sources say that the trojan activates before the 90th boot-up, some
even say that it activates on the first.

On Thursday, Panama declared war on the US. This is almost certainly
unrelated, as the trojan planning must have happened over the last
several months. But it will make it more difficult to investigate
the PO Box and the PC Cyborg Corporation.

PC Business World have reacted in a very responsible manner, even
though they are not to blame for the AIDS trojan;  they have
commissioned research into the effects of the diskette, and have
offered affected readers a program "AIDSOUT" that removes the obvious
files that the trojan installs.  They agree, however, that for maximum
caution, anyone who has installed the trojan should proceed as
outlined in this paper.

Conclusions

We may never know the full story of this program - what the intentions
were, and what the programs do.  But it is very surprising how many
people ran the trojan, and it is clear that many companies will wish
to take action to ensure that nothing like this ever happens in
future.  Demo diskettes sent through the post may become a thing of
the past, and diskettes on the front covers of magazines might be
adversely affected by the fallout.  Certainly, a number of companies
will change their rules about what people are allowed to load onto
their computers and what is not allowed, and some companies that
already have firm rules will probably be taking steps to enforce them.

Many companies that had previously been hit by a virus got off
lightly;  many PC support staff spoke to us and said that they had run
it on an isolated test machine, and as a result, were making sure that
no-one else ran it.  One company had PC support staff at the front
entrance, handing out warning leaflets as people entered in the
morning.

Other companies have been hit hard, with the program going into its
trojan phase, and making their computers inaccessible, at least
temporarily.



APPENDICES

Appendix 1 - The blue piece of paper

The enclosed blue piece of paper says, on the front:


AIDS Information - Introductory Diskette

Please find enclosed a computer diskette containing health information
on the disease AIDS.  The information is provided in the form of an
interactive computer program.  It is easy to use.  Here is how it
works:

The program provides you with information about AIDS and asks you
questions

You reply by choosing the most appropriate answer shown on
the screen

The program then provides you with a confidential report on
your risk of exposure to AIDS

The program provides recommendations to you, based on the life history
information that you have provided, about practical steps that you can
take to reduce your risk of getting AIDS.

The program gives you the opportunity to make comments and ask
questions that you may have about AIDS

This program is designed specially to help:  members of the public who
are concerned about AIDS and medical professionals.

Instructions

This software is designed for use with IBM (R) PC/XT tm microcomputers
and with all other truly compatible microcomputers.  Your computer
must have a hard disk drive C, MS-DOS (R) version 2.0 or higher, and a
minimum of 256K RAM.  First read and assent to the limited warranty
and to the license agreement on the reverse.  [If you use this
diskette, you will have to pay the mandatory software leasing fee(s).]
Then do the following:

Step 1:  Start your computer (with diskette drive A empty).

Step 2:  Once the computer is running, insert the Introductory
Diskette into drive A.

Step 3:  At the C> prompt of your root directory type:  A:INSTALL and
then press ENTER.  Installation proceeds automatically from that
point.  It takes only a few minutes.

Step 4:  When the installation is completed, you will be given
easy-to-follow messages by the computer.  Respond accordingly.

Appendix 2 - Details of the installation

When you run A:INSTALL.EXE, the following happens. First, it clears
the screen, and puts up in a box:

                  _________________________________________

Then, it puts up the following:

When you press ENTER, you are returned to the C prompt.



Appendix 3 - How to remove it

It would seem that you can disable the trojan by simple changing the
AUTOEXEC so that the REM# program no longer runs, and then you could
tidy up the various hidden subdirectories.  We do not recommend this
procedure, for the following reason.

Many researchers have run the install routine, and they have all
reported that no other executables on the disk are changed.
Unfortunately, this negative evidence is not proof, and if you want to
adopt the maximum caution in removing the trojan, you have to make the
assumption that under some circumstances, it might modify another
executable, in order to do damage later.  We have not observed it
doing this, but we cannot prove that it doesn't without a full
disassembly of the trojan.  Until this is done (it will take several
months, at least), we would suggest that people wanting to adopt the
maximum caution proceed as follows.

1. Switch off the computer
2. Put a known clean Dos diskette in drive A.
3. Switch on the computer
4.  Copy any recent data onto diskettes;  do not run any executables
on the hard disk.
5.  Low level format the disk (if you don't know how, consult your
manuals).  Make sure that you enter the bad track table, if any.
6. Run Fdisk to partition the disk.
7.  Format the disk.  Some computers combine steps 5 to 7, and some
programs (such as Disk Manager) make this process easier.
8.  Replace all executables from a backup made before the trojan was
installed.
9. Replace the recent data that was copies at step 4.

This procedure will not mean that you lose any data, but it does take
longer than running a program to remove the hidden directories and
other material installed on the disk.  The advantage of this
procedure, is that it makes certain that, if the trojan has altered
any of your executables, you will not have any unpleasant surprises
later.  If you decide to do this procedure at a later date, it will be
more of a nuisance, as you will have to go back further in time to get
a pre-trojan backup.

Appendix 4 - The encryption of filenames

When the trojan is triggered, it encrypts most of the file names
on the disk, using the Dos RENAME function. This isn't trapped by
active monitor programs such as Flushot Plus. It encrypts only files
which are not readonly, and only files with an extension from the
list given below. The encryption system is very simple, and is as
follows. Filenames are encrypted, extensions are encoded using the
list below.

Appendix 5 - The damage routine

After you have booted the computer 90 times (that 90 has been reported
as other values elsewhere, so it could be a variable), the trojan
triggers.  It tries to read from drive A, and either does so,
or hangs the computer. When you start up again, you get:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
]                                                                          
]              Please wait  30  minutes during this operation.             
]                                                                          
] WARNING - do NOT turn off the computer because you will damage the files 
]                                                                          
]    on the hard disk drive.   You will receive more information later.    
]                                                                          
____________________________________________________________________________

The 30 changes to 29 (sometimes to 28, 27 or 26) after a while, and
then you get:

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

        Sorry for the long delay ... still processing ... please wait.        *
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

This is left on the screen for a short while, and then you get:


Please wait during this operation.  Warning, do not turn off the computer while

the hard disk drive is working.  A flashing hard disk access light means: WAIT!


This stays up for a very long time while the disk light flashes$ the
program is writing the very long data file that fills up the disk.
When it is finished, it puts up:

                  ]                                         
                  ]     and then press ENTER or RETURN.     

                  ___________________________________________

The software renewal diskette is presumably the diskette that you
are expecting back from Panama. We put in a blank formatted
diskette, and the program replied with:

It then put the following up on the screen, and then printed out
the invoice again:

After a short while, it went into the routine that we have named the
SHARE routine.


Appendix 6 - the Share routine

The SHARE routine is an attempt to persuade you to install the
trojan on another computer. It offers you another 30 applications
if you follow this routine. It starts off by putting up the
following on the screen:

             _____________________________________________________

It then writes a file called SHARE.EXE onto the diskette, and puts
up another message.

            \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
            ]                                                     

            _______________________________________________________


When you do that, the trojan is installed on another computer.

While this is going on, it puts up the message:

                      Sharing in progress

After returning to the first computer, you get:


              You have been credited with 30 more applications.

               These applications will begin at the time that

               you renew your software lease.  Renew the lease

                     now to resume use of the computer.





                     Press ENTER or RETURN to continue.



But you don't get the promised 30 applications.  Instead, whatever you
do on the computer, gives you this message:


WARNING!  You risk destroying all of the files on drive C.
The lease for a key software package has expired.    Renew
the lease before you attempt any further file manipulation
or other use of this computer. Do not ignore this message!

The program is pretending to be the Dos C> prompt, and it parses
whatever you type - most things it doesn't understand.  But if you
type DIR, it shows you a file that consists of the original,
directory, before it was encrypted.  Also, the command CD works, and y
you can see other subdirectories, the same way.

It understands SET and VER, but it interprets SETx as SET where x can
be anything.  Clearly the parser goes as far as a match, then stops.

If you reboot with a soft reboot (Ctrl-Alt-Del) then the reboot is
faked;  the floppy diskette is accessed, but not booted from.  But if
you hard boot from a Dos diskette, and do a dir, you see a file called
CYBORG.DOC, 1327 bytes long, containing the following.

          If you are reading this message, then your software lease
          from PC Cyborg Corporation has expired. Renew the software
          lease before using this computer again. Warning: do not
          attempt to use this computer until you have renewed your
          software lease. Use the information below for renewal.

There is also a file on the hard disk called CYBORG.EXE. This is a
small EXE file - when disassembled, all it seems to do is set the DS
register to the current segment, and then exit with an errorlevel
of 0. But it also has some misdirection after that, as it contains
the following after the code:

<false end-file-marker>  <The Norton Utilities cannot read this file
because the FAT has been locked>

This message, plus the bytes that make up the rest of CYBORG.EXE
is stored in INSTALL.EXE near the end of the file as a string of
bytes encoded as their decimal equivalents, and separated by commas.

In the description below, we use # to denote Ascii 255, and  to
denote a space character (Ascii 32).

After the damage routine is triggered, there are several more files
in the ######. subdirectory.  The file _.__ disappears, and files
are added. The first new file is ____._, which is a one-byte
file containing an end-of-file marker. The second file is called
__._, which contains the directory of the root, and each subdirectory,
before encryption. These are in a format as if someone had done
a DIR and rediected the output to a file. This file could be used
to decrypt the file names, although it is easier to use the table that
we have prepared in appendix 4. When the file was first created, it
was called ALLFILES.REC, but  it is then renamed to __._

The next file is called __._, and this contains the message that you
would get if you type VER.  Next comes a file called ___._ containing
the text "IO.SYS", and another file called ___.__ containing just
an end-of-file.

The next file fills up the rest of the disk; it is
called  ____._, and appears to be a database. Records are 10058
bytes long, and look like this:

DATA RECORD #1         930568    749048.6
DATA RECORD #2         252774.1   51595.27
DATA RECORD #3         162639.1  994685.6

The disk is filled up by this file. There doesn't appear to be
any pattern to the "data" in this file.

An interactive program for health education on the disease AIDS
designed for use with IBM PC/XT computers and true compatibles
requiring a hard disk drive and a minimum of 256K memory
                       I N T R O D U C T I O N
Welcome to the interactive computer program called AIDS Information. This
program is designed to provide up-to-date information about you and the
fatal disease AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome). The health
information provided to you by this program could save your life.
Here is how the program works: First, the computer will ask you a series
of questions about your personal background, behaviour and medical
history. Then the program will calculate your chances of being infected
with the AIDS virus and inform you about your present degree of risk.
Then it will provide you with advice on what you can do to reduce your
risk of future infection, based on the details of your own lifestyle
and history. Finally, it will give you the chance to ask questions or to
make comments.
         U S E   T H I S   P R O G R A M   I N   P R I V A T E
The disease AIDS is often transmitted from person to person through
sexual contact. For that reason, many of the questions and answers in
the program are of a highly personal nature. For example, there are
questions about the details of your sexual behaviour. So we strongly
recommend that you use the program while you are alone, and not while
you are in the presence of other people. When answering the questions,
remember that you can be completely honest with the computer because
it keeps no records of your answers and it does not ask for your name.
Honest answers will allow the program to give you good, accurate advice
in return.
Please share the program diskette with other people so that they may
benefit from it, too. You may give them the program diskette because you
will not need it again now that you have installed it on your computer.
But you must first read and assent to the printed limited warranty and
license agreement before you may share or distribute this software.
    W H A T   Y O U   N E E D   T O   K N O W   A B O U T   A I D S
The disease AIDS is caused by a virus called HIV. The virus is passed
from person to person by sexual contact, by sharing blood products, and
through dirty needles & syringes. At the present time there is no cure
for the disease, and it is always fatal once it develops. Only people
who have the AIDS virus develop the disease AIDS. But not all people who
are infected by the virus have the actual disease. Instead, some
carry the virus for years and appear to be healthy. However, these
carriers are at risk of developing the actual disease as time passes.
Also, they are able to transmit the virus to other people with whom they
have sexual relations.
Since there is no cure for the disease, the only means by which you
can protect yourself is prevention. You can prevent being infected
through safe behaviour.  Minimizing the number of your sexual partners
and practicing safe sex are the two best ways to reduce your chances of
becoming infected. The purpose of this program is to help you understand
exactly what you can do to avoid infection.    Now, the program...

After careful analysis of the information that you have provided, we
offer you the following confidential advice:
You are advised that your risk of contracting AIDS is so large that
it goes off the chart of probabilities. Your behaviour patterns are
extremely dangerous, and they will very likely kill you. You are
doing a number of things that make it almost certain that you will
become infected with the AIDS virus, if you don't have it already.
Read the advice below carefully:
 This infant requires special medical attention. It is at risk because
  its mother may have passed the AIDS virus to it before it was born.
 Consult a doctor for additional information.
 When you grow up, avoid sex until you marry.
 There is no other practical advice that we can offer to young children.
Good behaviour!  For safety, avoid sex outside of marriage.
Continue to be faithful to one sex partner because that is safe.
Try to stay with one sex partner in the future for your own safety.
Decrease the number of your future sex partners to only one person.
Warning: Stay with one sex partner in the future.
Danger: You must reduce the number of your sex partners.
Danger Warning: Reduce the number of your sex partners now!
Extreme Danger: You must reduce the number of your sex partners now!
Get professional medical advice about your drug problem.
Buy condoms today at a pharmacy when you leave your office.
Always use them during sex -- never have sex without them.
See a doctor immediately; you may be very ill.
Reduce the number of your sex partners to avoid future infections.
Stay with only one sex partner to protect yourself and others.
Do these things now without delay. You have no time to waste.
Do these things to save your life and for the sake of all humanity.
You must use condoms when you have sex for your own safety.
Using condoms is the most important thing that you can do.
See a doctor immediately; you may be very ill.
Reduce the number of your sex partners to avoid future infections.
The more sex partners that you have, the greater your risk.
You are in a very dangerous risk category. You must take some steps
now to save your life. Choose your future sex partner with very
great care and have only one. Always use a condom if you have sex
outside of marriage. Follow this advice if you want to live.
We recommend that you use condoms when you have sex for your own safety.:
Using condoms is the most important thing that you can do.
Consider visiting your doctor for a check up.
You are in a dangerous risk category, but it is not too late for
you to take steps to save your life. Choose your future sex partner
with great care and have only one.  Always use a condom if you have
sex outside of marriage. If you ignore this advice you will be sorry.
Your medium risk of exposure to the AIDS virus is unacceptable if you
value your life. Take some practical steps now to reduce your risk
before it is too late. Stay with one sexual partner in the future
and use a condom if you have sex outside of marriage.
Consider visiting your doctor for a check up.
Your medium risk of exposure to the AIDS virus is unacceptable if you
value your life. Take some practical steps now to reduce your risk
before it is too late. Reduce the number of your sexual partners.
Have only one sexual partner in the future to significantly lower
your risk, and use a condom if you have sex outside of marriage.
Consider visiting your doctor for a check up.
Your risk of exposure to the AIDS virus is low, but considering that
AIDS is a fatal disease, you should take steps to further reduce your
risk. First, stay with one sexual partner in the future. Second, if
you have sex outside of marriage, then use a condom.
Your risk of exposure to the AIDS virus is low but it is increasing.
You must now change from your past patterns of having more than one.
sexual partner. If you continue to have more than one sexual partner
then you will you have a much greater risk of exposure in the future.
And it is very important for people in your risk group to use
a condom if they have sex outside of marriage.
You are like the majority of people in the world - you have a very low
risk of exposure to the AIDS virus. In fact, your risk is so small that.
there is not much that you can do to make it smaller. But you can do
something to avoid increasing your risk in the future. Avoid sexual
relations outside of marriage. Practice safe sex using a condom if you
do have sex outside of marriage. Keep the number of your future sexual
partners to a minimum. Insist that your sex partner be mutually
faithful to the relationship.
At the present time, your risk of previous exposure to the AIDS virus
is very small.  But you will face increasing danger in the future if
you continue your pattern of having sex with more than one partner.
As the AIDS virus spreads around the world, the chance that one of your
sexual partners will have it increases with time. In the future,
practice safe sex using a condom, if you have sex outside of marriage
Reduce the number of your sexual partners. Insist that your sex
partner be mutually faithful to the relationship.
According to our calculations that are based on the information that you
have provided, you have no measurable risk of contracting AIDS. If you
are worried about having AIDS, then you may be assured that you do not
need to worry. However, it is important for you to know that if your
behaviour changes in the future, then your risk of getting the AIDS virus
will also change. If you become sexually active in the future, then be
sure to practice safe sex with one partner.

You are welcome. We are happy that you found this program useful.
Scientific studies show that you can not catch AIDS from insects.
Condoms are effective protection against the AIDS virus. But they can break:
during intercourse. And they must be used from the very beginning of a sex
fact to the end of it. Most pharmacies, drug stores, clinics and family
planning organizations have condoms available in
Computers can do some remarkable things. It is all a matter of good
programming. Because AIDS in such a great threat to human life, we did our
best to make this program usable and relevant.
No, there is no know cure for the disease AIDS. Prevention is the only
protection. Safe behaviour including keeping the number of sex partners
small and choosing them wisely is the best course of action.
There is no drug at the present time that can prevent or cure AIDS. But
there are medicines that can fight the other infections that often accompany
AIDS. See a doctor if you want specific advice or detailed information.
You mentioned toilet. It is not possible to catch AIDS from public toilets.
Furthermore, transmission of the disease through the fecal-oral routine has
not been documented.
Mosquitoes do not appear to be AIDS vectors. In other words, you will not
get AIDS from a mosquito.
The AIDS virus is easily transmitted by contaminated blood. The majority of
people who receive contaminated blood during a transfusion become infected.
Likewise, dirty needles and dirty syringes easily transmit the virus. But
it is safe to donate your blood through the blood bank. If you need a blood
transfusion yourself, it is possible to screen the blood for the AIDS virus
lbefore you receive it to be sure it is safe. Ask your doctor for details.
This computer program is interactive. In other words, it responds to
different people in different ways, depending upon the information that
they provide and the questions that they ask. Frankly, we wonder why there
are not more programs like this one available for health education.
Computers could be powerful weapons in mankind's fight against disease.
There is only a small chance of getting the AIDS virus through saliva.
Casual kissing appears to be safe. Open mouth kissing appears to be more
dangerous. It is that which often follows open mouth kissing that is most
risky. Food contaminated with saliva has not be shown to be a source of AIDS
infections. Similarly, public spitting, although unhygienic, does not cause
AIDS infections.
The AIDS virus does not pass through normal skin, so casual contact between
people does not spread it. For example, shaking hands with and AIDS victim
is not dangerous. However, contamination of ones skin with infected blood
should be avoided. Medical personnel should wear protective clothing when
they expect to be exposed to blood or blood products.
An infant can be infected with the AIDS virus before it is born if the
mother of the infant has been infected with the virus. The chance that an
unborn infant will get the virus if its mother is infected is about 50%.
The AIDS virus can also be transmitted through breast milk, although the
risks involved for a breast feeding infant are not well known at present.
There is reasonable evidence indicating that the AIDS virus first entered
the human population on the continent of Africa. Accordingly, the virus has
has more time to spread among the peoples of that continent. It also appears
that AIDS is rapidly becoming the most serious health threat in the region.
Because it affects people most commonly in their productive years of life,
social and economic costs of this disease will be very great. At the present
time central African and eastern Africa are most seriously affected, with
the disease reaching epidemic proportions in some major cities. However, all
countries in Africa have cases of AIDS, so prevention and safe behaviour is
important everywhere, including in
The AIDS virus has infected different populations to different degrees. At
the present people of African origins are at the greatest risk. This pattern
exists for a number of reasons. First of all, people who live in Africa have
been exposed to the virus for a longer period of time. Secondly, people of
African origins who live in the First World may be exposed to the virus at
high rates due to socio-economic and cultural reasons. And although the
people of all races appear to be susceptible to the disease AIDS, there is
the possibility of racial variation in susceptibility as there is with
other diseases like malaria and skin cancer. The high frequency of AIDS
among African people has led to some considerable controversy and to
polarization on the issue. Valuable time and energy that could be used in
combating the spread of the disease has been lost during unwise efforts by
some to debate its origins and to deny its very existence.
But regardless of your personal views about the origins of the virus, do not
expose yourself to danger by denying that a serious threat exists not just
for Africans but for all of humanity.
AIDS can be prevented by avoiding the virus.  It is transmitted by sexual
contact, through blood contact, and from mother to unborn child.
The best way to prevent infection by the AIDS virus is to avoid sex or to
practice safe sex with one partner. Safe sex means to use a condom if you
are in doubt about your partner's possible previous exposure to the AIDS
virus or if you may have been previously exposed to the virus yourself.
Homosexual men have a particularly large risk of exposure to the AIDS
virus. This high risk follows from the means by which the virus is passed
from one person to another. The virus is transmitted from an infected
person to a healthy one through body fluids or through blood. Homosexual
men are commonly exposed to both body fluids and to small amounts of blood
during homosexual sexual behaviour.  Male homosexuals who are promiscuous
that means having many different sex partners) have the greatest risk
of infection. Homosexual women or lesbians do not have a high risk of
exposure to the AIDS virus. Bisexual women are exposed to the same risk
of AIDS virus infection as other women who have sex with men. In
conclusion, having unprotected sex with an infected man is dangerous for
anybody. If you are a male homosexual, then always use a condom during sex.
Lesbian women do not have a high risk of AIDS infection. But bisexual
women face the same risks of exposure as heterosexual women. All peoples
can protect themselves from AIDS infections by choosing their sex partner
with great care.C
The risk of AIDS infection and it's relationship to circumcision is
somewhat complex. First of all, circumcision by traditional means can be
dangerous because unsterile tools may be used during the actual process
of circumcising. For example, the person being circumcised could be
infected by the AIDS virus if the same knife was used previously on
another person who was a carrier of the virus. There is another aspect
of circumcision that should be mentioned here: Some evidence exists which
indicates that uncircumcised men have a greater chance of infection with
the AIDS virus than circumcised men do. The reasons for this pattern are
not yet entirely clear. Overall, male circumcision if practiced under proper
medical supervision appears to be a healthy practice. And unfortunately,
traditional male and female circumcision practices without medical
supervision appear dangerous in terms of AIDS virus exposure.
Scarification for ritual or decorative purposes is dangerous in terms of
AIDS virus transmission. This practice is almost always carried out under
conditions that prevent proper sterilization of the tools. Since the tools
come into contact with the blood of more that one person, they are able to
transmit the virus from an AIDS carrier to an uninfected person.
You mentioned semen. The AIDS virus is present in the semen of a man who has
been previously infected by the virus. That man may not show any of the
symptoms of the disease AIDS, but he can still transmit the disease to
others. Men who think that they may be carriers of the AIDS virus must
always use a condom to protect others from infection, and to protect
themselves from further infection by sexually transmitted diseases.
The AIDS virus may appear in small quantities in the tears of an
infected person. However, exposure to tears is not likely to be a major
mode of transmission of the disease.
The AIDS virus can be transmitted during tattooing if dirty needles are
used. Tattoo needles must be treated like surgical instruments. They must
be fully sterilized before use. They must never be shared among people if
they cannot be sterilized before each usage.
For household use you may destroy the AIDS virus with ordinary household
chlorine bleach when cleaning linen, utensils, bathrooms, etc. Do not use
bleach on wounds. If you are a medical professional, then you need more
information. See the World Health Organization publication entitled:
WHO AIDS SERIES 2, Guidelines on Sterilization and High-Level Disinfection
Methods Effective against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). It is
ISBN 92 4 121002 8.
If a wife and husband are mutually faithful to each other, and if neither
was previously infected by the AIDS virus, then sex within marriage is
very safe. However, if a husband or wife is infected with the AIDS virus,
then it is likely that they will infect their spouse. Promiscuity is
equally dangerous for married and unmarried people. Stay with one sexual
partner and insist that your spouse does likewise.
Anal intercourse for men and women is a likely means of AIDS transmission
if one of the two people are infected with the AIDS virus. Anal intercourse
commonly damages the lining of the intestine and causes bleeding. This
injury and the associated bleeding increase the chances of infection.
Condoms appear to provide some protection to both partners during anal
intercourse.F
AIDS is sometimes called Slim disease, particularly in eastern Africa.
AIDS is a social, economic and political problem as well as a medical one.
Social structures will be disrupted, economies will be burdened and health
care resources will be overstretched as the number of AIDS cases increase.
A virus is a very small disease-producing organism.  Many human diseases
including AIDS, polio and measles are caused by viruses.
Those people who are infected with the HIV virus do produce antibodies,

types of HIV have been discovered so far.
Seropositive means that a person has been tested for infection with HIV,
and that antibodies have been found in that person's blood. That means
the person has been exposed to the virus, but it does not necessarily
mean that the person has the disease AIDS.  AIDS can be diagnosed by the
clinical symptoms associated with the serious AIDS-related illnesses.
ARC is a condition in which a person has illnesses caused by the HIV virus,
but does not have the cancers and other fatal AIDS-related infections.
Symptoms of AIDS include weight loss, skin tumours (like Kaposi's sarcoma),
fungal infections (like Candida albicans), lung infections (like
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia) and degenerative brain disorders.

changesl incontinence and senility.

unborn child.

You need to be very careful in the future because many of your
potential sex partners
are AIDS virus
carriers. Carriers may look and act healthy, but you can still be
infected by them. Be smart and protect your health with safe behaviour.
The AIDS virus can be transmitted by sexual intercourse in
the same way as other sexually transmitted diseases. Now is
the right time to change your behaviour and to start practicing
safe sex. Safe sex means only one sex partner and/or using condoms.
